¿What's an Expression? Is any unit of code that results in a value

If I have a function that prints a string to the console, it's not an Expression,
because it doesnt result in a value, it's just an statement. Otherwise if the function
is putted into memory or in a variable, then, it's an Expression, because now, this unit of code (the function) is putted into memory and it returns a value.

**First class functions**<br>
Functions are objects and can be treated as is. So, said that,
I can assign a function to a variable, I can return a function as a result of another function. I can pass a function as an argument to another function

Functions that can be created on the fly
Fisrt class functions are unit of code that can be passed as an argument to a function
