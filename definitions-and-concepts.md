Â¿What's a namespace?
Is a container for variables and functions

Javascript doesnt have namespaces, we can fake it, using objects as a namespaces.

**Creation Phase** <br>
In the creation phase Javascript will assign a reference memory to variables and functions.

**Execution Phase** <br>
In this phase, Javascript will execute all the variables and functions with memory assigned in the previous phase (creation phase).

**Classical function** <br>
Is code that has the capacity to be executed. Functions are objects in the pure manner, all in javascript are objects.

**Collision** <br>
Collision is when two or more variable are override it and the last declaration has the value assigned.
