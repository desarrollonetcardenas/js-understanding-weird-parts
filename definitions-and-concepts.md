¿What's a namespace?
Is a container for variables and functions

Javascript doesnt have namespaces, we can fake it, using objects as a namespaces.

**Creation Phase** <br>
In the creation phase Javascript will assign a reference memory to variables and functions.

**Execution Phase** <br>
In this phase, Javascript will execute all the variables and functions with memory assigned in the previous phase (creation phase).

**Classical function** <br>
Is code that has the capacity to be executed. Functions are objects in the pure manner, all in javascript are objects.

**Collision** <br>
Collision is when two or more variable are override it and the last declaration has the value assigned.

**Callbacks** <br>
Call backs are functions passed as argument to another function and executed in
synchronous way.

Any unit of code that results in a value it's an expression
An expression is a unit of code that results in a value
A unit of code that the result is put into memory is an Expression
An Expression is any unit of code that results in a value
Any unit of code that results in a value is an Expression
¿What's an Expression? Is any unit of code that results in a value

If I have a function that prints a string to the console, it's not an Expression,
because it doesnt result in a value, it's just an statement. Otherwise if the function
is putted into memory or in a variable, then, it's an Expression, because now, this unit of code (the function) is putted into memory and it returns a value.

**Statement**<br>
Statement is a unit of code that it doesnt return a value
Statement is a unit of code that it doesnt return a value

**First class functions**<br>
Functions are objects and can be treated as is. So, said that,
I can assign a function to a variable, I can return a function as a result of another function. I can pass a function as an argument to another function

Functions that can be created on the fly
Fisrt class functions are unit of code that can be passed as an argument to a function
